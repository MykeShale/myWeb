				<h2>Corona Virus: Utilizing Time While at Quarantine.</h2>
			</div>
			
			<!--	Things to do	-->
			<div class="five-things">
				<p class="p-one">
					Wanna make coronavirus laughüòÄ? Tell it about your plans. Because of the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 disease, many people
					will have to give up on their planned trips as the virus has spread to more than a hundred countries. Because of
					coronavirus, Princess Beatrice has postponed her wedding ceremony, and Orlando Bloom and Katy Perry decided to do the
					same. All schools and educational institutions are closing, mass gatherings and large events are being canceled, you
					cannot even climb Everest this season as China and Nepal shut down all expeditions for the rest of the year.
				</p>
				<h3 class="end"><strong>*		*		*</strong></h3>
				<p class="p-two">
					Our team collected <strong><i>5 ideas</i></strong> about what to do while being in self-isolation at home that will
					not let you get bored. Here‚Äôs what we <strong>strongly recommend</strong> you to do during COVID-19 quarantine:
				</p>				
			</div>
			<div class="to-do">		
				
				<li>
					<h3>1. Practice Sport at Home</h3>
					<p>We all know that a sedentary lifestyle will backfire sooner or later. People call all diseases associated
						with a
						sedentary lifestyle, ‚Äúan invisible epidemic.‚Äù It is unlikely that you‚Äôll be able to walk your average
						daily steps at
						home, but we still urge you to not lie down on the sofa for too long. Summer is just around the corner,
						and your
						buttocks will not exercise without you, just like your beer belly will not magically disappear. Install
						one of the
						home workout apps and do different exercises every day, but don‚Äôt overdo it! Your aim is not to injure
						yourself, but
						simply to move around. So, in order not to bail on the whole thing after the second workout because of
						laziness, have a
						competition with your friends online. For instance, spend your daily meeting in a plank position.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>2. Clear Out Your Wardrobe</h3>
					<p>
						Decluttering your clothes and clearing out your wardrobe are activities you could spend long hours on.
						Sort your clothes
						into thematic piles: to keep, to sell, to donate. Perhaps the time has come to sew the missing button to
						the shirt you
						used to wear at school (you will surely fit into it after working out at home, right?). This is also an
						excellent
						opportunity to play a stylist and try to match clothes that would seem incompatible at first glance.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>3. Clean the Windows and Declutter Your Home</h3>
					<p>
						The most useful thing to do while social distancing at home is to reorganize your stuff and keep it
						clean. For instance,
						even in the cleanest houses, windows often remain dusty and stained as cleaning them is not the most
						pleasant thing, and
						it‚Äôs usually wet and cold. The peak of the pandemic falls on warmer months, which makes it a good reason
						to spend
						several hours cleaning the windows and looking at the world without distortion. At the same time, don‚Äôt
						forget to wash
						the curtains, which accumulate dust and dirt from the street that you then breathe. A great way to
						reboot is to get rid
						of those ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù things that nobody actually uses. If you can take nice pics of them, you can also
						make good money
						by placing an ad and selling them on social networks or on a special online platform such as eBay.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>4. Learn to Live in Peace</h3>
					<p>
						If you share your living space with relatives or just roommates, allocate responsibilities for the
						quarantine period.
						Everyone should keep the space clean! The current situation is not that simple, and staying together 24
						hours a day may
						well lead to annoyance, that is why one should not forget about personal boundaries and interests.
						Everything is not
						that bad either, though, there are plenty of ways to spend time together apart from watching series. You
						can also cook
						together, play chess or other board games together ‚Äì this will help you find common ground.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>5. Meditate</h3>
					<p>
						Quarantine is a great opportunity to be silent. You can try to meditate on your own or use special apps.
						The easiest way
						of meditation is to scan your body. Lie on your back, close your eyes and alternately focus on different
						parts of your
						body, sliding attention from your toes up to the top of your head.
